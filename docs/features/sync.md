# Sync

Read when:

- changing rsync behavior;
- debugging missing or stale files on a runner;
- changing Git seeding, fingerprints, excludes, or env forwarding.

Crabbox syncs the current checkout to the leased runner before running a command.
It syncs the Git-managed working set, not the whole directory tree:

- tracked files from `git ls-files --cached`;
- nonignored untracked files from `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`;
- root `.crabboxignore` patterns, repo-local `sync.exclude` patterns, and
  Crabbox's default cache/generated-output excludes.

Ignored output, dependency folders, `.git`, and common local caches stay out of
the transfer. This keeps first syncs close to the code that CI would see while
still letting agents test uncommitted edits.

Default generated-output excludes cover common local churn such as `.ignored`,
`.vite`, `playwright-report`, `test-results`, and local `.crabbox` log/capture
directories. They are intentionally conservative: Crabbox does not globally
drop tracked source files just because a path segment is named `build` or
`out`. Put project-specific generated directories in `.crabboxignore` or
`sync.exclude`.

Sync flow:

1. pick the local repository root;
2. seed remote Git from the configured origin/base ref when possible;
3. build a NUL-delimited sync manifest from Git's tracked and nonignored file list;
4. print a full candidate estimate plus a dirty-delta estimate when local changes exist, then enforce configured large-sync guardrails;
5. compute or reuse a sync fingerprint from the commit, dirty metadata, and manifest;
6. skip rsync when the fingerprint matches;
7. feed the manifest to rsync with `--files-from=- --from0`;
8. delete previously managed remote files that disappeared from the manifest when delete sync is enabled;
9. run sanity checks for mass tracked deletions;
10. hydrate configured base-ref history for changed-test workflows.

The remote manifest deletion step only removes paths Crabbox previously synced. It does not delete workflow-created state, package caches, `.git`, or other local runner files outside the managed file list. Native Windows static targets use the same Git manifest but transfer it as a tar archive over OpenSSH instead of rsync.

In remote Git worktrees, Crabbox stores its sync metadata under `.git/crabbox` so repository status stays clean. Crabbox does not delete files under the worktree `.crabbox/` directory; that path remains available for repository-owned files and config.

Important controls:

```text
CRABBOX_SYNC_CHECKSUM
CRABBOX_SYNC_DELETE
CRABBOX_SYNC_GIT_SEED
CRABBOX_SYNC_FINGERPRINT
CRABBOX_SYNC_BASE_REF
CRABBOX_SYNC_TIMEOUT
CRABBOX_SYNC_WARN_FILES
CRABBOX_SYNC_WARN_BYTES
CRABBOX_SYNC_FAIL_FILES
CRABBOX_SYNC_FAIL_BYTES
CRABBOX_SYNC_ALLOW_LARGE
CRABBOX_ENV_ALLOW
```

Defaults:

```yaml
sync:
  timeout: 15m
  warnFiles: 50000
  warnBytes: 5368709120
  failFiles: 150000
  failBytes: 21474836480
  allowLarge: false
```

`crabbox run --force-sync-large` bypasses the fail thresholds for one run. `--debug` adds rsync progress/stat output; normal syncs still print a heartbeat when rsync is quiet for a while.

When the checkout has local changes, guardrails count the dirty delta instead
of the full manifest. Output still includes the full candidate size so first
sync cost remains visible:

```text
sync candidate: 299 files, 14.2 MiB dirty_delta=7 files, 92.4 KiB
```

For noisy worktrees, `crabbox run --fresh-pr owner/repo#123 --apply-local-patch`
is usually faster and clearer than syncing the whole local checkout. The remote
starts from the PR head, then Crabbox applies the local patch on top.

Use `crabbox sync-plan` to inspect the local manifest before leasing a box. It
prints the candidate file count, total bytes, and the largest files/directories
using the same excludes as `run`. Large sync warnings from `run` also include
the top source directories by file count so accidental dependency repair or
generated churn is easier to spot before forcing a huge transfer.

Repo-local config should hold project-specific excludes and env allowlists. Secrets must not be passed as command-line arguments or broad env globs.

Use `.crabboxignore` when you only need repo-local sync exclusions. The file is
read from the repository root. Blank lines and lines starting with `#` are
ignored; remaining lines are appended to `sync.exclude` and use the same matcher
as config excludes. Crabbox intentionally supports only `.crabboxignore`; there
is no short alias.
