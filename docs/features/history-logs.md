# History And Logs

Read when:

- changing run recording;
- debugging failed remote commands;
- deciding what belongs in coordinator history.

Coordinator-backed `crabbox run` creates a durable `run_...` handle before
leasing starts. As the CLI advances, it appends ordered events for leasing,
bootstrap, sync, command start, stdout/stderr chunks, command finish, and lease
release. Stdout/stderr events are capped at 64 KiB per run and followed by an
`output.truncated` marker when the cap is reached. When the command exits, the
CLI finishes that run with:

- exit code;
- sync duration;
- command duration;
- total duration;
- owner and org;
- provider, class, and server type;
- optional Linux telemetry snapshots for load, memory, disk, and uptime, including bounded mid-run samples for longer runs;
- retained remote output.

Use:

```sh
crabbox history
crabbox history --lease cbx_...
crabbox events run_...
crabbox attach run_...
crabbox logs run_...
```

In the authenticated browser portal, `/portal/runs/<run-id>` renders the same
run as a human page with command metadata, result summary, searchable/paginated
recent events, compact resource deltas, short telemetry trend lines, and a
copyable retained log tail.
`/portal/runs/<run-id>/logs` stays a plain-text log endpoint, and
`/portal/runs/<run-id>/events` stays JSON for copying or browser-side
inspection.

History records and run events live in the Fleet Durable Object. Log text is
stored separately from run metadata and intentionally capped so noisy commands
cannot exhaust storage. Logs larger than one storage value are chunked by the
coordinator and reassembled by `crabbox logs`. Event output capture is also
bounded; use `crabbox attach` for active run previews and `crabbox logs` for the
retained command output.

For local, uncapped debug artifacts, `crabbox run` can mirror streams with
`--capture-stdout <path>` and `--capture-stderr <path>`. These captures are
local-only and bypass coordinator run-log storage. Use distinct local paths for
stdout, stderr, and `--download remote=local` artifacts; Crabbox rejects
collisions before command execution. Failed SSH-backed and Blacksmith delegated
runs write local `.crabbox/captures/*.tar.gz` bundles by default. Treat captured
logs and bundles as secret-bearing files unless the caller redacts them.

Commands can add timing detail by printing `CRABBOX_PHASE:<name>` on stdout or
stderr. Phase markers appear in `--timing-json` as `commandPhases`; the marker
line remains in normal output so scripts and humans see the same stream.

Direct-provider mode does not have central history. Use shell output or local
terminal logs there.
